Use pandas to read data  
use values of pandas to extract features (X) in Numpy  
Set the missing values using strategy = mean in Imputer object of sklearn preprocessing class  
Use LabelEncoder for targets (y)  
Use OneHotEncoder for features (X)  
Method for both is the same:    
1. Initialize object of the class with required parameters as arguments    
2. pass the data 'fit' method of the object   
3. receive and replace the data accordingly
